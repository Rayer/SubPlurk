Any plurk scraps in my timeline, we can assumed all of them are from friends. So if we get friend first, we can access avatar urls without querying plurk's owner's 
whole timeline(to get user_data structure)

load and update friend list and fetch their's avatar first.

Make a storage database to put avatar cache of friends, a FileSystemResourceProvisioner seems a good choice(or maybe InternetResourceProvisionerToFile?)
